    "My first attempt involved two functions:  one to determine whether an array (sorted) was a geometric progression by checking that the ratios of all its successive elements are all the same, and one to count how many such subarrays of length 3 there are in the given array.  The latter function works by running every combination in `itertools.combinations(array)` of length 3 through the first function.  I was not surprised to find that, while it worked for some smaller test cases, the majority failed due to timeouts.  That is a recurring theme in my experience of HackerRank."
