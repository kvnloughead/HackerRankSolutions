    "Suppose a person Alice is playing a game with scores ranked using __dense ranking__: all ties are given equal ranks, and no numerical ranks are skipped.  For example, the scores 10, 7, 7 and 5 would have ranks 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.   You are given an array of scores `alice` for games that Alice plays, along with the `scores` already on the leaderboard (in descending order), and you are supposed to compute the ranks corresponding to those scores.  That is the problem in a nutshell."

    "Now, to retrieve the correct rank from `ranks`.   Note that the rank of a `score` placed at index `place` by `bisect_right_desc` will be determined by its value compared to its neighbor to the left.  In particular, if `score` is equal to its neighbor to the left, then its rank will equal that neighbors rank, while if this is not the case, the rank of `score` will be incremented by one.   Another thing to note is that if `place = 0` we cannot take `place-1` as the index for the left hand neighbor of `score`, since in Python `arr[-1]` is the last element in `arr`.  An `if: else` will work around this issue."
