    "> Starting with a 1-indexed array of zeros and a list of operations, for each operation add a value to each of the array element between two given indices, inclusive. Once all operations have been performed, return the maximum value in your array. \n",
    "\n",
    "Translation:  You have a 1 indexed (and one-dimensional) array `A` of zeros, and will be given a collection of tuples `(a, b, k)`.  For each tuple in the collection, must add `k` to each element in `A[a:b+1]`.  Once done, return the max value.\n",
