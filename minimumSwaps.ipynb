After quite a bit of thinking, the solution is actually quite simple.  Instead of making swaps such that the element at the current index gets put in its place, make them so that the current index recieves its correct element."

    "This iteration is successful for most test cases provided by HackerRank, but fails 5 due to timeout.  I'm sure the issue is with all the calls to `arr.index` within the for loop.  We might be able to elimate these with a form of memoization.  Basically, as we iterate through the array, when we come upon a misplaced element we note its position in a dictionary.  Then when we find the element that should go there we can quickly put it in place, since dictionary lookups are cheap.  Let's try it."
