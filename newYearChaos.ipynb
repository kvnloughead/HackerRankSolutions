Also, note that any person having bribed P could not get any further than P-1, since no one can move more than 2 places forward.  Taken together, this gives us the following method for counting the number of times person P has been bribed:  we simply count the number of persons Q with Q>P in the range `arr[P-1 : arr.index(P)]`.
